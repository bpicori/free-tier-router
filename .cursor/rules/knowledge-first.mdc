# Knowledge First

Before starting any implementation or making changes to the codebase, always check the `knowledge/` folder for relevant documentation.

## Guidelines

1. **Search knowledge first**: When working on a feature or fixing a bug, look for related documentation in `knowledge/` before writing code
2. **Understand existing patterns**: The knowledge folder contains architectural decisions and system explanations that should guide implementation
3. **Keep knowledge updated**: When implementing new features or changing existing behavior, update the relevant knowledge files

## Knowledge Files

- `knowledge/model-aliases.md` - How the model alias system works (resolution flow, alias types, custom aliases)

## When to Check

- Before implementing model-related features → check `model-aliases.md`
- Before adding new providers → understand how aliases map to provider models
- Before modifying routing logic → understand the resolution flow
